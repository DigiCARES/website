Funded by the Hamm Institute for American Energy, Dr. Ying Zhang of Oklahoma State University is leading a three-year project, “Trustworthy AI for Distributed Energy System Operation toward Grid Security and Edge Intelligence.” The effort will develop AI methods that enable edge devices—such as solar inverters, EV chargers, and smart meters—to make safe, real-time decisions, strengthening grid resilience against disturbances and cyber threats.

This work aligns with DigiCARES’ mission to advance AI-driven, climate-aware energy resilience across partner states.
