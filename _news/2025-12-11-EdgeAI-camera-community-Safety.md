DigiCARES is partnering with Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC) to deploy ultra–low-cost “Grid Sentinel” edge-AI wildfire detection cameras across high-risk areas in northern New Mexico. These units are among the first major technology outcomes of the DigiCARES project and highlight our commitment to community engagement and climate resilience.

Each Grid Sentinel device combines a camera, a compact computing board, and a communications module, drawing power directly from nearby distribution poles. Instead of streaming video to remote servers, AI models run locally on the device (“at the edge”) to detect smoke and flames in real time. When a potential ignition is identified, the camera sends an alert that can be shared with utility operators and local partners for rapid follow-up.

A key innovation of this system is its ability to interface with power-system operations. The Grid Sentinel units are designed to integrate with SCADA systems and microgrid controllers so that, under elevated wildfire risk, the grid can be reconfigured or islanded to protect critical infrastructure and keep the lights on for local communities.

This collaboration with KCEC also creates hands-on opportunities for students, researchers, and practitioners. Field deployments provide real-world testbeds for improving AI models, refining alert workflows, and gathering feedback from line crews, emergency managers, and residents about what information is most useful during high-risk conditions.
