We’re pleased to share that our DigiCARES wildfire edge-AI detection work has been featured in an NMSU Newsroom story.

This deployment follows a full year of testing and validation. Now, after about two and a half months of continuous real-world operation, we’re seeing strong momentum—both in terms of system performance and the new questions and opportunities that come from operating at the edge in live conditions.

Looking ahead, the DigiCARES team is planning additional installations and expanded field collaboration. If you’re interested in partnering on deployment, evaluation, or complementary sensing/analytics, we’d welcome a conversation.
