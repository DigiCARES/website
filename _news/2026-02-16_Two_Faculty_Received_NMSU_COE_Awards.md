DigiCARES is pleased to share that two faculty members affiliated with the project have recently been recognized by the New Mexico State University (NMSU) College of Engineering for their outstanding contributions to the college and broader research community.

Dr. Fengyu Wang has been selected to receive the Faculty One-College Synergy Award. This distinction recognizes exceptional commitment to collaboration and the ability to create positive, measurable impact across the College of Engineering. Dr. Wang’s work reflects the spirit of cross-disciplinary partnership—bringing together colleagues, students, and stakeholders to advance shared goals in research, education, and service.

In addition, Dr. Di Shi has received a College of Engineering faculty award recognizing excellence in research and leadership. Dr. Shi’s contributions include sustained leadership of multi-institutional research programs, development of high-impact partnerships, and strong commitment to student mentorship and workforce development. His efforts have helped elevate NMSU’s visibility and impact through externally funded research and collaborative initiatives.

Both awards will be formally presented at the COE Faculty and Staff Awards Banquet on February 27 at the NMSU Golf Course Banquet Room.

DigiCARES congratulates Dr. Wang and Dr. Shi on these well-deserved honors and celebrates their continued leadership and service to the NMSU community.
