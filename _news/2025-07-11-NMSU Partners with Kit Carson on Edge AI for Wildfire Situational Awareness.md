New Mexico State University has received funding support from Kit Carson Electric Cooperative to develop edge AIâ€“based wildfire situational awareness technology. The project is led by Dr. Di Shi, with Dr. Fengyu Wang and Dr. Patricia Sullivan serving as co-PIs.

This initiative aims to enhance real-time situational awareness for system operators and microgrid controllers, enabling faster and smarter response to wildfire threats. It represents a direct, real-world impact for the community and strongly aligns with the goals of the DIGICARES project.
