New Mexico State University will lead a $14.2 million feasibility study for a pumped-storage hydropower facility proposed on Navajo Nation lands in the Four Corners region. The award includes $7.1 million from the U.S. Department of Energy and $7.1 million in cost share, with support from the State of New Mexico and other partners. The study will assess technical, environmental, transmission, and economic feasibility for a design targeting approximately 1,500 MW of generation and about 70 hours of energy storage.

The project is led by Principal Investigator Dr. Fengyu Wang (NMSU ECE) in close collaboration with the Navajo Nation. The project leadership team also includes Dr. Di Shi and Dr. Patricia Sullivan from the NMSU DigiCARES team.

This effort will enhance the impact of DigiCARES by deepening long-term engagement with the Navajo Nation (one of our priority communities), creating new opportunities for student training and local workforce development, and providing a real-world setting to validate DigiCARES’ digital-twin and AI tools for grid resilience and long-duration energy storage. It also expands partnerships across universities, national laboratories, industry, and government—accelerating the translation of research to practice and amplifying benefits for communities in the region.
