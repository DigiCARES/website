The NMSU DigiCARES team has been awarded a major grid modernization project by the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD), in partnership with Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC). The project includes $3.28M in EMNRD funding and $2.43M in cost share from KCEC, for a total project value of approximately $5.7M.

The project will build a utility-operated edge-of-grid microgrid within KCEC’s service territory in northern New Mexico, designed to improve reliability, resilience, and energy security for rural and wildfire-prone communities. The microgrid will integrate local renewable generation, battery energy storage, and advanced control and energy management technologies developed by the DigiCARES team at NMSU.

KCEC was identified as one of the three core community partners in the original DigiCARES proposal, and this award represents a major milestone in DigiCARES’ community-engaged research model. Through close collaboration with KCEC, the NMSU DigiCARES team will deploy and validate AI-enabled energy management, grid-edge intelligence, and wildfire detection technologies in a real operational environment that directly serves local communities.

This project demonstrates how DigiCARES translates university research into real infrastructure, delivering tangible benefits in grid resilience, community safety, and workforce development for northern New Mexico.
