In August 2024, the DigiCARES team visited Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC) to strengthen alignment between project objectives and the cooperativeâ€™s energy resilience priorities. The team met with KCEC leadership to discuss strategies for addressing challenges posed by climate variability and wildfire risk.

As part of the visit, the team toured five KCEC service sites historically impacted by wildfires to evaluate locations for deploying edge AI devices that support real-time grid monitoring and faster response during emergencies. These field assessments are key to enhancing both infrastructure protection and community safety in wildfire-prone areas.
