In August 2024, the DigiCARES project team visited the Navajo Nation for a full day of collaborative meetings with the President, Chief of Staff, and key members of the Nation’s leadership team. Discussions focused on aligning the goals of DigiCARES with the community’s urgent energy needs—especially in the areas of resilience, sustainability, and access.

The team gained critical insights into the unique energy challenges faced by rural and remote communities, highlighting opportunities for partnership on renewable integration, grid modernization, and affordable energy solutions.

This visit laid a strong foundation for ongoing collaboration, with the shared goal of developing energy strategies tailored to the Navajo Nation’s local conditions and long-term priorities.
