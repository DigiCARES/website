The DIGICARES project—“Accelerating Community-Centric Energy Transformation through AI-driven Digital Twinning for Climate-Aware Resilience”—has been awarded a $6 million grant from the National Science Foundation’s EPSCoR RII-FEC program.

This collaborative effort involves NMSU, OSU, MSU, UA Huntsville, and NCAR, and focuses on developing AI-powered digital twins to support energy resilience in underserved communities, including Kit Carson, Mora-San Miguel, and the Navajo Nation.

By integrating climate data, energy infrastructure, and community engagement, the project aims to improve energy efficiency, enable renewable integration, and reduce energy burden—while also promoting STEM education and workforce development across the participating states.
