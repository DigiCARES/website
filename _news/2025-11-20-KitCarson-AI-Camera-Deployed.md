DigiCARES researchers Dr. Di Shi and Dr. Fengyu Wang recently completed a successful field deployment with Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC), installing a networked set of edge-AI wildfire detection units in wildfire-prone areas of the Carson National Forest. This marks an important milestone in the DigiCARES mission to advance digital-twin technology, energy resilience, and community protection in Northern New Mexico.

Over the course of two days in the field, the DigiCARES team worked closely with KCEC to install lightweight, energy-conscious, and low-cost detection units designed to support 1) early wildfire identification, 2) situational awareness, and 3) coordination with energy-system operations. Each device contributes to a connected edge-AI network capable of detecting early wildfire indicators while operating efficiently in rugged, remote environments.

A distinguishing feature of this system is its ability to interface directly with microgrid controllers, enabling energy operators to take timely actions that help minimize potential impacts to critical infrastructure and maintain power continuity during high-risk conditions. This design reflects a long-term effort within DigiCARES to develop scalable, practical, and resilient AI technologies specifically tailored for rural utilities.

This deployment demonstrates meaningful progress in three key areas:

1. Advancing DigiCARES research and technical innovation.
The system builds on years of research in edge intelligence, wildfire situational awareness, and resilient energy systems. Transitioning this work into a real-world deployment highlights its technical maturity and relevance.

2. Strengthening regional partnerships.
KCEC is a critical partner in the DigiCARES project, serving communities across Northern New Mexico where wildfire remains one of the most significant risks. This installation reflects the strong collaboration and shared commitment between DigiCARES and KCEC to improve resilience and community safety.

3. Delivering direct value to the communities KCEC serves.
The networked system offers a scalable, low-cost approach that can be extended across the region to enhance early detection capabilities and inform operational decision-making during wildfire events.

The system is now fully installed, highly regarded by KCEC, and entering a real-world testing and validation phase. Additional deployments are planned for the coming year, and the data collected from the field will be used to further advance DigiCARES digital-twin modeling and resilience research.

DigiCARES acknowledges and thanks KCEC leadership and staff—including CEO Luis A. Reyes Jr., Richard Martinez Jr., Michael Ryan, and Daniel Trujillo—for their collaboration, field support, and continued partnership.
