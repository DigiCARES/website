The DigiCARES team at New Mexico State University recently completed an important field deployment in close partnership with Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC). Over two days in the Carson National Forest, the team worked alongside KCEC engineers to install a set of lightweight, energy-conscious, low-cost edge-AI wildfire detection units in strategically selected wildfire-prone areas.

These units operate collectively as a networked edge-AI system capable of identifying early wildfire indicators and providing real-time situational awareness. In addition, the system is designed to interface with microgrid controllers, enabling automatic actions that can help reduce potential impacts to critical infrastructure while maintaining service continuity during high-risk events.

Wildfire remains one of the most significant risks faced by KCEC and many utilities across northern New Mexico. This deployment represents a meaningful step toward scalable, community-oriented technologies that support wildfire resilience and grid reliability. The approach emphasizes ultra-low-cost, energy-efficient AI, making large-scale deployment more feasible across rural and underserved regions.

This successful installation reflects the strong cooperation between DigiCARES and KCEC, and would not have been possible without the dedication of the KCEC operations and engineering teams—Luis A. Reyes Jr., Richard Martinez Jr., Michael Ryan, and Daniel Trujillo—and the contributions of DigiCARES researchers, collaborators, and students.

The deployment also builds on years of research in edge intelligence, situational awareness, and resilient energy systems conducted through DigiCARES and NMSU’s engineering programs. The installation aligns with the project’s mission to advance digital-twin capabilities and support communities across New Mexico through practical, field-tested innovations.

In the coming months, the team will continue testing, analyze real-world data, and pursue additional deployments to expand coverage and deepen integration with energy-system resilience strategies.
