## <strong>Task 2.1 Conduct a Socioeconomic Status (SES) Analysis</strong>

Researchers assigned to this task include Dr. Haggerty, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Han,
Dr. Zhao, and Dr. Shanahan.

This task involves a deep dive into the social and economic dimensions of communities. This analysis is
utilized to prepare the research team and collaborators for effective community engagements and outreach,
and help craft tailored energy solutions that inform strategies for addressing the unique challenges and needs
of each community.

## <strong>Task 2.2 Utilize Proven Strategies for Conducting Community Conversations</strong>

Researchers assigned are Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Surova, Dr. Han, Dr. Shanahan, Dr.
Haggerty, Dr. Kirksey, and Dr. Shi.

This task promotes collaborative energy planning through community conversations. It uses stakeholder
analysis to understand influences and roles, and a community conversation model (illustrated in Figure 3) to
identify energy access and development challenges. This participatory model integrates community input into
energy solutions. These solutions will then enhance the AI-driven digital twin platformâ€™s ability to simulate
various energy scenarios.

## <strong>Task 2.3 Community-centric Energy System Design and Implementation</strong>

Researchers for this task are Dr. Han, Dr. Haggerty, Dr. Zhao, Dr. Wang, and Dr. Miller.

This task uses the insights from Tasks 1 and 2 to produce tangible energy solutions for communities. By
developing and deploying customized pilot energy systems that are attuned to the unique needs and expressed
preferences of each community we will integrate successful elements from these community-specific energy
systems into broader energy policies for the local communities and the states of the region.

## <strong>Task 2.4 Developing Context-Sensitive Energy Measures for the Digital Twin</strong>

Researchers include Dr. Han, Dr. Zhao, Dr. Haggerty, Dr. Zhang, and Dr. Surova.

This task will develop an integrated set of measures that comprehensively considers the socioeconomic context
of communities. These new measures will extend the existing ones, which predominantly focus on the
percentage of low-income, to account for a broader spectrum of socioeconomic attributes, providing a more
accurate and meaningful understanding of energy issues. These innovative measures will integrate into the
AI-driven digital twin, improving simulation accuracy and relevance, and informing policy recommendations
and decision-making.
