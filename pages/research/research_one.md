Our central scientific hypothesis posits that the escalating impacts of climate
change are exacerbating the energy burden and threatening the resilience of
energy systems, particularly in underserved communities. We hypothesize that
AI-driven digital twin technologies can effectively address these challenges
through enhanced forecasting, improved energy system planning, optimized
operations, and informed energy policy.

To rigorously explore this hypothesis, we have formulated the number of research
questions, each directly linked to specific research tasks. See the diagram
below for a general overview of how our research tasks, activities, and
deliverables are linked.
