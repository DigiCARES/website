Our central scientific hypothesis posits that increasing climate variability and
uncertainty are intensifying the energy burden and threatening the resilience of
energy systems, especially in regions with limited access to reliable resources.
We hypothesize that AI-driven digital twin technologies can effectively address
these challenges through enhanced forecasting, improved energy system planning,
optimized operations, and informed energy policy.

To rigorously explore this hypothesis, we have formulated a number of research
questions, each directly linked to specific research tasks. Figure 1 provides an
overview of how our questions, tasks, and outcomes are interconnected.
