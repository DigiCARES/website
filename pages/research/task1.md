## <strong>Task 1.1 Construct Cross-Scale Data Integration from Long-Term Weather Records and High-Resolution Simulations</strong>

The researchers assigned to this task are Dr. Hu, Dr. Junod, Dr. Dubois, and Dr. Spangler.

This task will develop an open-source geodatabase integrating long-term weather observations with high-resolution climate simulations. Observations will be collected with collaboration from state climatologists and use citizen science programs to include  a broad range of geographic areas. Finally, a WebGIS system with customized dashboards will be developed for interactive data exploration and analysis, supporting informed energy system planning and operation.

## <strong>Task 1.2  Identify Historical and Future Shifts in Climate at Multiple Scales in Shaping the Energy Sector</strong>

Researchers assigned are Dr. Hu, Dr. Dubois, Dr. Christy, Dr. Ashokkumar, and Dr. Shi.

This task focuses on identifying how historical and future variations in climate patterns at various scales affect
energy systems by synthesizing long-term observational data and simulations from 1980 to 2060, ranging
from local to state levels (illustrated in Figure 2). Results will be integrated into Task 1.1 to provide more
comprehensive testing of climate hypotheses.

## <strong>Task 1.3 Assess the Roles of Land-Atmosphere Interactions in Shaping Variability of Risks Associated with Evolving Climate Patterns in Energy System</strong>

Researchers assigned are Dr. Ashokkumar, Dr. Dubois, Dr. Hu, Dr. Zhang, and Dr. Spangler.

This task examines the impact of land-atmosphere interactions in shaping variability of risks associated with
evolving climate patterns in energy systems. The task focuses on how extreme weather events, intensified by
changing climate pattern, and influenced by human activities like urbanization and agriculture, affect energy
reliability. The goal is to identify areas of low energy resilience and predict future high-risk regions using
regional weather models.

## <strong>Task 1.4 Predict Climate-Driven Change in Renewable Energy Production</strong>

Researchers assigned are Dr. Hu, Dr. Dubois, Dr. Junod, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Wang, and Dr. Cui.

This task will develop methods to predict the impact of evolving climate pattern on renewable energy production. This task utilizes the comprehensive climate database developed in Tasks 1.1-1.2 to analyze historical weather patterns and project future variable renewable energy (VRE) outputs considering changing climate trends. The projections of VRE outputs will be validated and calibrated using data from various observational networks and resources. This task is vital for enhancing the understanding and management of renewable energy sources in the face of evolving climate conditions.
