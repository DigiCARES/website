## Task 1.1

**Construct cross-scale data compilation from long-term regional and national weather
observations and high-resolution historical and future climate simulations.**

The researchers assigned to this task are Dr. Hu, Dr. Junod, Dr. Dubois, and Dr. Spangler.

This task will create an open-source geodatabase to integrate long-term regional
and national weather observations with high-resolution historical and future
climate simulations. Observations will be collected with collaboration from
state climatologists and use citizen science programs to include rural and urban
communities.

## Task 1.2

**Identify historical and future shifting of climate at multiple scales in
shaping the energy sector**

Researchers assigned are Dr. Hu, Dr. Dubois, Dr. Christy, Dr. Ashokkumar, and Dr. Shi.

This task focuses on identifying how historical and future climate changes at
various scales affect energy systems by synthesizing long-term climate
observations and simulations from 1980 to 2060. Results will be integrated into
task 1.1 to provide more comprehensive testing of climate hypotheses.

## Task 1.3

**Assess the roles of land-atmosphere interactions in diversifying climate change-induced risks
in energy systems**

Researchers assigned are Dr. Ashokkumar, Dr. Dubois, Dr. Hu, Dr. Zhang, and Dr. Spangler.

This task examines the impact of land-atmosphere interactions on climate
change-induced risks to energy systems. The task focuses on how extreme weather
events, intensified by climate change, and influenced by human activities like
urbanization and agriculture

## Task 1.4

**Predict climate-driven change in renewable energy production.**

Researchers assigned are Dr. Hu, Dr. Dubois, Dr. Junod, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Wang, and Dr. Cui.

This task will develop methods to predict the impact of climate change on
renewable energy production. Utilizing the comprehensive climate database
developed in Tasks 1.1-1.2 to analyze historical weather patterns and project
future VRE outputs considering changing climate trends.
