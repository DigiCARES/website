## <strong>Task 5.1</strong>

**Develop and refine digital twins for the three communities.**

Research driven by Dr. Zhang, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Surova, Dr. Zhao, and Dr. Wang.

This task focuses on the development and refinement of digital twin models for
Kit Carson, Mora-San Miguel, and the Navajo Nation. This involves integrating
diverse datasets, including demographics, climate patterns, and energy system
specifics, to accurately represent each communityâ€™s unique energy
infrastructure.

## <strong>Task 5.2</strong>

**Evaluate energy infrastructure upgrade options.**

Research done by Dr. Wang, Dr. Spangler, Dr. Han, Dr. Haggerty, and Dr. Sullivan.

This task involves simulating and analyzing the impacts of specific energy
infrastructure upgrade strategies on climate resilience and energy burden within
each community.

## <strong>Task 5.3</strong>

**Analyze policy impact and energy scenarios with digital twins.**

Research done by Dr. Junod, Dr. Han, Dr. Kirksey, Dr. Sullivan, and Dr. Wang.

The task aims to merge forward-looking policymaking (FLPM) with the capabilities
of digital twin technology for scenario analysis and policy impact evaluation.
This task will use comprehensive simulations via digital twins to project
various energy policy and infrastructure scenarios, analyzing their impacts on
community resilience, energy equity, and sustainability.

## <strong>Task 5.4</strong>

**Report, recommend, and disseminate knowledge.**

Task driven by Dr. Zhao, Dr. Han, Dr. Junod, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Ashokkumar, and
Dr. Hu.

This task centers on compiling and synthesizing data and insights from digital
twin simulations and pilot studies into comprehensive reports. A critical aspect
of this task is the broad dissemination of these findings. The aim is to engage
policymakers, community leaders, and other stakeholders, fostering informed
discussions on climate resilience, energy equity, and sustainability.
