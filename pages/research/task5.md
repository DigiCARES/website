## <strong>Task 5.1 Develop and Refine Digital Twins for Communities</strong>

Research driven by Dr. Zhang, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Surova, Dr. Zhao, and Dr. Wang.

This task focuses on the development and refinement of digital twin models for communities. This involves
integrating different datasets, including demographics, climate patterns, and energy system specifics, to
accurately represent each community’s unique energy infrastructure (illustrated in Figure 6). Advanced
machine learning algorithms will transform these models into dynamic systems suitable for simulating various
future scenarios. Rigorous testing and refinement against actual data will prioritize technological accuracy and
community relevance. This refining process will also inform the development and methodologies established
in Task 4.4, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the digital twin framework. The success of this task hinges
on the models’ ability to adapt to a wide range of future energy scenarios and policies.

## <strong>Task 5.2 Evaluate Energy Infrastructure Upgrade Options</strong>

Research done by Dr. Wang, Dr. Spangler, Dr. Han, Dr. Haggerty, and Dr. Sullivan.

This task involves simulating and analyzing the impacts of specific energy infrastructure upgrade strategies
on resilience and energy burden within each community. This evaluation will provide insights into how these
technologies contribute to the community energy resilience, security and development.

## <strong>Task 5.3 Analyze Policy Impact and Energy Scenarios with Digital Twins</strong>

Research done by Dr. Junod, Dr. Han, Dr. Kirksey, Dr. Sullivan, and Dr. Wang.

The task aims to merge forward-looking policymaking (FLPM) with the capabilities of digital twin technology
for scenario analysis and policy impact evaluation. This task will use comprehensive simulations via digital
twins to project various energy policy and infrastructure scenarios, analyzing their impacts on community
resilience. By integrating data on climate patterns, demographic shifts, and energy consumption trends, the
task will provide detailed insights into the long term effects of different policy options. This approach enables
policymakers to proactively anticipate and address future energy challenges and opportunities.

## <strong>Task 5.4 Report, Recommend, and Disseminate Knowledge</strong>

Task driven by Dr. Zhao, Dr. Han, Dr. Junod, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Ashokkumar, and
Dr. Hu.

This task centers on compiling and synthesizing data and insights from digital twin simulations and pilot
studies into comprehensive reports. A critical aspect of this task is the broad dissemination of these findings.
The aim is to engage policymakers, community leaders, and other stakeholders, fostering informed discussions
on climate resilience. This approach ensures that the research’s impact extends beyond academia, influencing
policy decisions and empowering community action through shared knowledge and insights.
