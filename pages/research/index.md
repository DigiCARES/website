## Research

Our central scientific hypothesis posits that the escalating impacts of climate
change are exacerbating the energy burden and threatening the resilience of
energy systems, particularly in underserved communities. We hypothesize that
AI-driven digital twin technologies can effectively address these challenges
through enhanced forecasting, improved energy system planning, optimized
operations, and informed energy policy.

To rigorously explore this hypothesis, we have formulated the number of research
questions, each directly linked to specific research tasks. See the diagram
below for a general overview of how our research tasks, activities, and
deliverables are linked.

## Research Questions

 1. How are evolving local and regional climate patterns intensifying challenges
    within energy infrastructure and demand, especially in vulnerable communities?
 2. What are the most effective methods for integrating sociodemographic factors
    into energy planning considering heightened climate change risks?
 3. How can the integration of AI analytics with digital twin technology enhance
    our capacity to forecast, plan, and operate energy systems amid dynamic climate
    scenarios?
 4. What new community-centric models and methodologies can be developed to
    proactively address energy equity and resilience in the context of the changing
    climate? 
 5. How can vulnerability assessments focused on climate change impacts inform
    the development of energy policies that are both community-focused and
    climate-resilient?
 6. What are the essential indicators for assessing the effectiveness of
    AI-driven digital twin technologies in improving resilience and addressing
    energy inequity in the face of climate change?
