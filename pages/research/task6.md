## Task 6.1

**Integrate LLMs for enhanced feedback processing in digital twin system.**

Research done by Dr. Shi, Dr. Cui, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Haggerty, and
Dr. Dadgostari.

This task is dedicated to incorporating advanced LLMs into the digital twin
system, specifically to process feedback from community leaders, stakeholders,
and users. This interface will allow diverse stakeholders to effectively
interact with the digital twin, ensuring their insights are promptly reflected
in real-time updates and simulations.

## Task 6.2

**Enhanced data interpretation and visualization through LLM integration.**

Researchers are Dr. Shi, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Wang, Dr. Hu, Dr. Dadgostari,
Dr. Zhang, Dr. Cui, Dr. Dubois, and Dr. Haggerty.

This task aims to integrate LLMs into the digital twin system to enhance data
interpretation and visualization, making complex outputs understandable to a
wide range of users. By translating technical data into clear, actionable
insights, LLMs simplify the digital twinâ€™s outputs and highlight key trends in
an accessible manner.
