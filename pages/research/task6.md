## <strong>Task 6.1 Integrate LLMs for Enhanced Feedback Processing in Digital Twin System</strong>

Research done by Dr. Shi, Dr. Cui, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Haggerty, and
Dr. Dadgostari.

This task is dedicated to incorporating advanced LLMs into the digital twin system, specifically to process
feedback from community leaders, stakeholders, and users. A user-friendly human-machine interface will
be developed to allow stakeholders to effectively interact with the digital twin, ensuring their insights are
promptly reflected in real-time updates and simulations.

## <strong>Task 6.2  Enhanced Data Interpretation and Visualization through LLM Integration</strong>

Researchers are Dr. Shi, Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Wang, Dr. Hu, Dr. Dadgostari,
Dr. Zhang, Dr. Cui, Dr. Dubois, and Dr. Haggerty.

This task aims to integrate LLMs into the digital twin system to enhance data interpretation and visualization,
making complex outputs understandable to a wide range of users. By translating technical data into clear,
actionable insights, LLMs simplify the digital twinâ€™s outputs and highlight key trends in an easy-to-understand
manner. An illustration of Engage360 is shown in Figure 7.
