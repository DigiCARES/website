## <strong>Task 3.1 Develop Location-Based Metrics</strong>

Research driven by Dr. Shi, Dr. Dadgostari, Dr. Spangler, Dr. Hu, and Dr. Sullivan.

This task develops key metrics for climate-aware energy system resilience, covering service reliability, resilience
and adaptability. These metrics are essential for digital twins, informing climate adaptation simulations and
optimizations.

## <strong>Task 3.2 Model Interactions and Impact Dynamics</strong>

Researchers include Dr. Shi, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Cui, Dr. Dadgostari, and Dr. Spangler.
This task aims to develop impact assessment models for energy systems, utilizing baselines and metrics from
Task 3.1 to analyze “what-if” scenarios. An algorithm is designed to estimate resilience levels across multiple
scales, from individual households to entire communities.

## <strong>Task 3.3  Develop a Framework for Climate-Adaptive Multi-Timescale Infrastructure Optimization for Renewable Energy Systems</strong>

Researchers for this task are Dr. Wang, Dr. Dadgostari, Dr. Shi, Dr. Spangler, and Dr. Zhang.

This task develops a hierarchical optimization model to manage uncertainties from changing climate pat-
tern and weather extremes by focusing on renewable energy infrastructure planning, as shown in Figure 4.
Leveraging a multi-stage model for strategic energy system expansion, it addresses both long-term renewable
energy shifts and short-term fluctuations. This enhances the AI-driven digital twin’s simulation capabilities
for energy scenarios and infrastructure planning.

## <strong>Task 3.4 Model Community-Centric Load Restoration in the Aftermath of Power Outages</strong>

Researchers are Dr. Zhang, Dr. Spangler, Dr. Hu, Dr. Haggerty, and Dr. Wang.

This task aims to develop models for load restoration in communities following power outages, filling critical
gaps in current smart grid technologies. It addresses two main challenges: the under-researched area of
resilience infrastructure at the community level, and the tendency of existing restoration models to overlook
the needs of communities. These models will leverage primary and auxiliary variables from Tasks 2.1-2.3 to
promote fast electricity restoration across communities. This will enhance the digital twin’s functionality,
making it a more robust tool for scenario planning and decision-making, especially during weather-related
power outages.
