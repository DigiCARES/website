## Task 4.1

**Community-focused energy demand forecasting**

Researchers are Dr. Zhang, Dr. Wang, Dr. Shi, Dr. Spangler, and Dr. Cui.

This task is dedicated to developing community-level load forecasting models.
Utilizing historical energy usage data from utility billing systems and
additional insights from the American Time Use Survey, we will create predictive
models for community-level energy demand employing recurrent neural networks
(RNNs).

## Task 4.2

**AI-powered spatial-temporal renewable forecasting.**

Researchers are Dr. Shi, Dr. Junod, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Dadgostari, and Dr. Hu.

This task focuses on advancing the adaptivity and accuracy of renewable energy
forecasting within the digital twin, a critical aspect for sustainable energy
planning and operation. The task addresses the integration of long-term climate
changes and weather extremes into the behavior modeling of energy prosumers.

## Task 4.3

**High-fidelity future scenario generation.**

Researchers are Dr. Zhang, Dr. Cui, Dr. Shanahan, Dr. Shi, Dr. Spangler.

This task focuses on creating high-fidelity power system operating scenarios,
particularly under extreme weather conditions, to enhance the digital twinâ€™s
predictive capabilities.

## Task 4.4

**Development of an integrated climate-energy-community digital twin platform.**

Researchers are Dr. Cui, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Shi, Dr. Wang, Dr. Hu, Dr. Han,
Dr. Sullivan, and Dr. Christy.

This task aims to create an AI-driven digital twin framework that transcends
mere power systems replication to encompass the entire climate-energy-community
nexus. By integrating physical power system models with state-of-the-art climate
solution simulators like En-ROADS and the C-ROADS climate policy model, the
framework will be capable of conducting comprehensive simulations.
