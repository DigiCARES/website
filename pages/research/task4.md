## <strong>Task 4.1 Community-Focused Energy Demand Forecasting</strong>

Researchers are Dr. Zhang, Dr. Wang, Dr. Shi, Dr. Spangler, and Dr. Cui.

This task is dedicated to developing community-level load forecasting models. Utilizing historical energy
usage data from utility billing systems and additional insights from the American Time Use Survey, we will
create predictive models for community-level energy demand employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

## <strong>Task 4.2 AI-Powered Spatial-Temporal Renewable Forecasting</strong>

Researchers are Dr. Shi, Dr. Junod, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Dadgostari, and Dr. Hu.

This task focuses on advancing the adaptivity and accuracy of renewable energy forecasting within the digital
twin, a critical aspect for energy planning and operation. The task addresses the integration of long-term
resilience and weather extremes into the behavior modeling of energy prosumers.

## <strong>Task 4.3 High-Fidelity Future Scenario Generation</strong>

Researchers are Dr. Zhang, Dr. Cui, Dr. Shanahan, Dr. Shi, Dr. Spangler.

This task focuses on creating high-fidelity power system operating scenarios, particularly under extreme
weather conditions, to enhance the digital twin’s predictive capabilities. To address the limitations of current
data climate-energy co-simulation data infrastructures, typically characterized by fragmentation and limited
scale, our strategy involves compiling comprehensive, authoritative data from open-source databases and
IEEE standard benchmark systems. This task will boost the digital twin’s capacity to simulate complex
power systems across different environmental conditions.

## <strong>Task 4.4  Development of an Integrated Climate-Energy-Community Digital Twin Platform</strong>

Researchers are Dr. Cui, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Shi, Dr. Wang, Dr. Hu, Dr. Han,
Dr. Sullivan, and Dr. Christy.

This task aims to create an AI-driven digital twin framework that transcends mere power systems replication
to encompass the entire climate-energy-community nexus. By integrating physical power system models with
state-of-the-art climate solution simulators like En-ROADS and the C-ROADS climate policy model, the
framework will be capable of conducting comprehensive simulations. As shown in Figure 5, a comprehensive
digital twin framework is developed to integrate the findings from Task 1 to Task 6.
