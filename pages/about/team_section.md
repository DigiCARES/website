        The DigiCARES team began with the researchers who initiated the project and secured support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Their ongoing work drives the scientific and technical advances that enable us to empower communities. Beyond the core research group, many others have contributed to DigiCARES through business, outreach, marketing, and operational support. Meet our team members and contributors below.
