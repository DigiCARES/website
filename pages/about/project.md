## Project

DigiCARES is a transformative initiative aimed at improving energy systems
planning and operation across New Mexico, Montana, Oklahoma, and Alabama by
utilizing advanced AI, digital twin technology, and renewable energy solutions.
The project specifically targets underserved communities in these areas. Its
goals are to optimize energy utilization, increase renewable energy integration,
and improve climate resilience. The project also focuses on fostering workforce
development in AI and energy systems while promoting diversity in STEM
education.

To do this, DigiCARES will develop an AI-driven digital twin to assist in the
goal of becoming more climate aware and resilient.
